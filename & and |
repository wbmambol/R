# logical operators work perfectly fine with vectors and matrices.
 # Use logical operators to vectors and matrices. What do these results tell us? 
#  The third day of the recordings was the only day where your LinkedIn profile was visited more than 10 times, 
 # while your Facebook profile wasn't.
 # The social data (linkedin, facebook, views) has been created for you

# linkedin exceeds 10 but facebook below 10
linkedin>10 & facebook<10

# When were one or both visited at least 12 times?
linkedin>=12 | facebook>=12

# When is views between 11 (exclusive) and 14 (inclusive)?
views>11 & views<=14
