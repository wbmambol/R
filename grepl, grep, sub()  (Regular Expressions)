grepl(), which returns TRUE when a pattern is found in the corresponding character string.
grep(), which returns a vector of indices of the character strings that contains the pattern.
Both functions need a pattern and an x argument, where pattern is the regular expression you want to match for, and the x argument is the character vector from which matches should be sought.

# Use sub() to convert the email domains to datacamp.edu
sub(pattern="@.*\\.edu$", "@datacamp.edu", x=emails)
