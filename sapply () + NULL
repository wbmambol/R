# sapply() does not simplify the list of NULL's. That's because 
the 'vector-version' of a list of NULL's would simply be a NULL, 
which is no longer a vector with the same length as the input. 


# Definition of print_info() function

# Apply print_info() over temp using sapply()
sapply(temp, print_info)

# Apply print_info() over temp using lapply()
