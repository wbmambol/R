Use abs() on linkedin - facebook to get the absolute differences between the daily Linkedin and Facebook profile views. Place the call to abs() inside mean() to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation. In the mean() call, make sure to specify na.rm to treat missing values correctly!
# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, NA, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, NA, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Calculate the mean absolute deviation
mean(abs(linkedin-facebook), na.rm=TRUE)
