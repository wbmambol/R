The function factor() will encode the vector as a factor

# Sex vector
sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert sex_vector to a factor
factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

# Print out factor_sex_vector
print(factor_sex_vector)

# It is clear that there are two categories, or in R-terms 'factor levels', at work here: "Male" and "Female".

# a nominal categorical variable and an ordinal categorical variable.

# A nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order. This means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'. 
# For example, think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories "Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey" and "Horse". Here, 
# it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other. (Note that some of you might disagree ;-) ).

# In contrast, ordinal variables do have a natural ordering. 


# If you don't specify the levels of the factor when creating the vector, 
# R will automatically assign them alphabetically. 
# To correctly map "F" to "Female" and "M" to "Male", the levels should be set to c("Female", "Male"), in this order.

# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)

# Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
levels(factor_survey_vector) <-c('Female','Male')

# Create speed_vector

Comparing ordered factors


# Create factor_speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

# Factor value for second data analyst
da2 <- factor_speed_vector[2]

# Factor value for fifth data analyst
da5 <-factor_speed_vector[5]

# Is data analyst 2 faster than data analyst 5?
da2>da5
