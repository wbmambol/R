BREAK - - - - - - - -  
This seems like a great opportunity to include the break statement in the while loop you've been working on. Remember that the break statement is a control statement. When R encounters it, the while loop is abandoned completely.
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 88

while (speed > 30) {
  print(paste("Your speed is", speed))
  
  # Break the while loop when speed exceeds 80
  if ( speed>80) {
    break    
  }
  
  if (speed > 48) {
    print("Slow down big time!")
    speed <- speed - 11
  } else {
    print("Slow down!")
    speed <- speed - 6
  }
}

Finish the while loop so that it:

prints out the triple of i, so 3 * i, at each run.
is abandoned with a break if the triple of i is divisible by 8, but still prints out this triple before breaking.

# Initialize i as 1 
i <- 1

# Code the while loop
while (i <= 10) {
  print(3 * i)
  if ( 3*i %% 8 == 0) {
   break 
    print(3 * i)
  }
  i <- i + 1
}
